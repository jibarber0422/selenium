# Messing around with Selenium
I was looking up some ways I can automate tasks and ran into learning about Selenium. After a bit of research, I was able to make a script that takes an excel sheet and can input the data within into a browser. 

In the example I did at my internship, I had a excel sheet with profile ID's and engagement strategies and would look up the account using the profile ID section. Once the account was found, it would find the drop box element with the engagement strategies and would input it according to the excel sheet.

Some challeneges I had writing this script was bypassing the login page and the 2FA required when accessing this page.
